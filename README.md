# Trailblazers: COVID-19 VOLUNTEERS
This project **aims** to tackle **COVID-19 crisis**. Due to sudden outbreak of Coronavirus disease, the number of cases is rising at alarming rate. ***We need more of doctors, nurses, assistance workers and paramedics***. India can produce **1.5 lakhs young doctors** if the ***final year medical students*** are authorized to practice. In this *project we are going to direct a route to medical students, whether they are in college, hostels or their homes, they will be able to reach their nearest **COVID-19 Testing Sites***. This project is done using [Python], [Flask], [Django], [HTML], [CSS] and [Geo-location]. We are coming up with this project so as to address the shortage of doctors, nurses, assiatance workers and paramedics.
