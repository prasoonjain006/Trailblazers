                                         ERROR = The reson of their occurence

SMTP_SSL has no attribute 'encode' = when smtplib not working properly or installation problem due to some reasons
unused import statement = when smtplib used first time it was creating a problem so use SMTP from smtplib rather than importing it directly,
                         or in case try to optimize imports if it works in my case it did'nt work
						 
unresolved refernce smtp = becoz smtplib not working or not imported 
                           if smptlib is making more problem then see from command prompt if it is installed or not ,if not then install
                           it first
